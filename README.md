# About This Repo

This is a github repo in which I have uploaded all my wallpapers which I use on my main system.

# Where Did I Get These Wallpapers?

I find these wallpapers in a number of different locations but good places to check out include [Imgur](https://imgur.com/), [/wg/](https://boards.4chan.org/wg/), [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/). Some of the wallpapers were probably included in default wallpaper packages from various Linux distributions, Some from reddit, Some from github and from Internet.

# Ownership
Because I downloaded most of these from sites like Imgur, Reddit, /wg, etc. I have no way of knowing if there is a copyright on these images. If you find an image hosted in this repository that is yours and of limited use, please let me know and I will remove it.
